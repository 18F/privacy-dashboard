This Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is generally the most sensitive information included in the system. Other information includes payroll, accounting, pay and leave entitlement records, payroll deduction and withholding, and time and attendance records.

There are four tiers of users, as categorized by PII access. “Tier one” users are employees that can access their own personal data only, for example personal contact information, benefit election information and time and attendance records. Examples of “tier two” users are an employee’s supervisor who has access to information including that employee’s home address, personal contact information, and time and attendance records but specifically excluding Social Security Number (SSN) and date of birth (DOB). “Tier three” users are comprised of a subset of GSA OHRM staff users who may have a need to access employees’ SSNs or DOBs, as well as the information available at tiers one and two. “Tier four” users are a different subset of GSA OHRM staff who may need access to voluntarily reported employee data including race and national origin to evaluate how GSA is meeting its policies and practices on hiring and retaining minorities, women, and disabled persons, analyzing their status in the workforce; and for establishing workforce diversity goals and timetables.

HR Links receives information about GSA employees from the systems listed below:
Payroll, Accounting and Reporting (PAR) system –PAR is GSA’s payroll processing system and the link between the GSA’s HR and accounting systems. HR Links sends updated personnel data to the payroll system along with the time and attendance information required to perform payroll actions.

login.gov manages user authentication by allowing users to sign in with an email address, password, multi-factor method, and “identity proofing” by verifying an individual's asserted identity on behalf of partner agencies. User authentication is the process of establishing confidence in user identities electronically presented to an information system. Identity proofing is the process of verifying that a person is who they say they are. PII must be collected from a login.gov user to identity proof that user at an Identity Assurance Level (IAL) required by a partner agency to grant access to its information, applications, programs, or records (for the purpose of this PIA, ‘‘services''). The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines IAL as “a category that conveys the degree of confidence that the applicant’s claimed identity is their real identity.”5

Identity assurance levels categorize “the degree of confidence that the applicant’s claimed identity is their real identity.”6 login.gov operates at two levels of identity assurance, IAL1 and IAL2. A user will only be asked for information necessary to achieve the IAL required by the partner agency to access a given service. IAL1 provides a partner agency very limited assurance that the same individual who created the login.gov account is, in fact, accessing that partner agency’s service or information.7 This PIA analyzes how login.gov works at both IAL levels; how login.gov manages information as a strategic resource;8 incorporates NIST's definitions of privacy risk; and describes how login.gov mitigates such risks.9","System records will be disposed of in accordance with NARA’s General Records Schedule (GRS) Transmittal 29, section 3.2 “System access records,” which covers user profiles, log-in files, password files, audit trail files and extracts, system usage files, and cost-back files used to assess charges to partner agencies for usage of login.gov.","With the user's consent, the user's email address and agency UUID will be shared with a partner agency. If the partner agency requires identity proofing information for users authenticating via login.gov, then those users’ self-asserted PII, including name, address, social security number, birth date and/or contact phone number could also be transmitted pursuant to the user’s consent and the agreement between login.gov and the partner agency. That information is encrypted during transit using Transport Layer Security over Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (TLS over HTTPS) and inside either a Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) or OpenID Connect (OIDC) signed payload. The user's phone number for calls or text messages from the third-party multi-factor authentication service provider and additional information required for IAL23 identity proofing are also encrypted using TLS over HTTPS during transmission.", GSA/TTS-1

Each line on the ""file distribution list"" contains the file name, the adjustments required to the file, the POCs for the distribution, their email addresses, and whether the file needs to be encrypted. Encryption is determined based on a flag within the ""file distribution list."" Files flagged for encryption are encrypted and password protected. The encryption flag is based on PII and/or who is getting sent the file. If it has PII and being sent outside of GSA, then it is encrypted. The encryption flag is determined by the Payroll Team. The bot can only pull contacts off of one line at a time and after each line is completed, the variables are cleared, so that should mitigate any risk of sending files to incorrect contacts.
